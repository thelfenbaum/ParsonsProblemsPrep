<h2>What is this Project?</h2>

The code here is the initial steps towards building Parsons Problems with lines of code split into fragments for the user to drag and drop into specific locations. This code initiates blocks which can be dragged and dropped.

This code was written in one-on-one sessions directed by a PhD student at UCSD who I worked with over summer 2022, helping with a research project. The purpose of our coding sessions were to help me to develop my font end skills, and for the two of us to think through how to program a stable prototype of the tool he had built and we were in the process of researching together.
